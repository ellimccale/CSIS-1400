# Student Management System
You are a database administrator for a university and need to be able to manage students, their transcripts, and tuition balance. To do that, you will be asked how many new students will be added to the database, and then prompted to enter the first and last name for each student. Each student will be assigned a five-digit unique ID. The student can enroll in any course; for example, a student can enroll in History 101, English 101, or CSIS 1400, and each course has a set tuition amount. Once all students have been entered, you will have the option to view student info (such as name and ID), view student transcripts, edit transcripts to enroll students in courses, view tuition balance, and pay tuition balance.
